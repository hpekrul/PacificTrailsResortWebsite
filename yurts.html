         <h3>What is a Yurt?</h3>
            <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully
                enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</p>

      <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
            <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
           Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.
                Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>

        <h3>what should I bring?</h3>
            <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather
            with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of
        Adventure!</p>
